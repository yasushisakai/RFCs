Since the beginning of human history, murals have functioned as a medium
to prove ideas and existence.

Now recognized as a form of art, “graffiti” began as an act of
vandalization in the ’80s and ’90s, which itself started as a means of
expressing one’s existence through “tagging.”

In recent years, Citys and those communities have used urban murals to
reveal the neighborhood’s local character.

Makuhari City would like to follow this custom and manifest it as a
non-existent collective consciousness through mural painting. At the
same time, consider cultural creation and propose this as the city’s
first art project.

As a virtual social city, I would like to use the construction site’s
temporary enclosure as a medium instead of a permanent wall.

I want to carry out this project by following the process below.

1. (Deliberation on the overall direction of the project)
2. Artist nomination
3. Selection of (3) artists
4. (Deliberation phase)
5. Submission of the first draft
6. Vote on the draft (remixing ratio)
7. (Remixing deliberation phase)
8. Submission of the Second Draft
9. (Final draft deliberation)
10. Mural art decision
11. Production
12. Exhibition
13. Demolition
14. Split ownership and operation by the city as NFT

Elements in parenthesis will be time dedicated to deliberation through
the city communication channel.
